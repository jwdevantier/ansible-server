# Bootstrap Hosts
# ===============
#
# Use by combining with the 'bootstrap' role.
# To ensure other playbooks bootstrap hosts as needed, import this playbook before
# any other plays, example:
#
#
# ### [test-playbook.yml] ###
# ---------------------------
# - import_playbook: bootstrap.yml bootstrap_user=pseudo bootstrap_pass='my-secret-password'
# - hosts: home.lab
#   tasks:
#     - debug:
#         msg: "hello, world"
# ---------------------------
#
# This will kick of this playbook which will install the regular ansible user and lock down
# SSH (disable password authentication, disallow root login).
# Note: any additional bootstrapping is up to your regular roles.
#
#
# How it works:
# -------------
#
# Fresh machines generally allow for some form of password login. This playbook tests
# whether it can log in to the host via a provided SSH password and if so, the host is
# considered eligible for bootstrapping.
#
# The next play uses a group compiled from all the hosts for which password login succeeded
# and runs the 'bootstrap' role which installs a default admin user, installs its SSH keys,
# and takes some basic steps to secure SSH, as described above.

# Issues
#
# Port is hard-coded to 22. Cannot receive port as a variable as 'port: <>' must receive
# an integer value and no matter what, the value remains a string.
